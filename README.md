  <p>Some advice for the piscine if you are currently in it:</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbspBefore going for correction of a project make shore to, </p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVerify if you have all files</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck the file names</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck if they have the header</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck if they pass by the “Norminette”</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck if there’s more files than needed (ex. a.out)</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck if they pass by the compiler with the FLAGS (-Wall -Wextra -Werror)</p>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCheck for different inputs</p>
